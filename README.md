EXTREMELY-Basic-Calculator
One of my first ever projects, super basic calculator that takes two numbers uses and operation and spits out another number.
Coded in C#

Keep in mind I watched like 2 videos on C# and tried by best to make something that works, expect bugs, the point of this is to look back on this later.
